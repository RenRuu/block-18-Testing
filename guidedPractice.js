/*You were hired by a global hotel chain to redesign the functionality of the button panel on their elevators. 
The goal is to replace the outdated panel in over 1,200 different locations. Before you begin coding, you should make a list of all 
the ways these panels should be tested to make sure they are working correctly and respond to unexpected input in a 
way that makes sense.

To complete this guided practice, write as many Unit Tests as possible. If time allows, write at least one 
integration, functional, and acceptance test. Be sure to label each test with its 
associated type (Unit, Integration, Functional, Acceptance).
